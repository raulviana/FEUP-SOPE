- First assignment:
The first assignment objective was to develop a small forensics program that receives a folder name as an argument and recursively analyses every file in it and its sub-folders. Files are analyzed for its metadata and its checksums (md5, sha1, and sha256). For each file, the program *forks* and analyzes it in a different process. Log file's created and updated with files information.

- Second Assignment:
Home banking simulation using *pipes*, *threads*,  and *output redirection*.
The client processes send pre-determined messages to the server to authenticate and ask for certain services.
The server opens a new thread to process each client's requests.
